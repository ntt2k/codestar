*Grio Code Challenge – “Code Star”*
 
Demo: http://codestar-ntt2k.c9users.io/

Source: https://github.com/ntt2k/codestar
 
 
The task is to build an app that lets you enter two people’s Github usernames. The app should use the Github API to get a list of repositories for each user and order them by number of stars.
 
There should be a count of total stars for each user and a user should be declared a “winner”.
 
Features/Requirements:

+ Enter two Github usernames
+ List each account’s repos in order of stars
+ Display total stars for each user
+ Display an average “stars per repo” for each user
+ Declare a winner

(optional) Toss in any other cool stats (you could even use them to help determine a winner, just make note if you modify the win condition).
